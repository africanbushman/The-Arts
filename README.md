#Description

The website is an art style website dedicated to pushing local art/photography.
The purpose of this would be to deliver the local art, whatever the form, to the client.
This would help local artists improve their reach and scope of influence.

The site would also have an 'Explore' function that allows users to find art that best suites
their tastes.

The site would also have a donate function, where users would be able to donate funds
(undisclosed figure) to their favorite artist; the aim of this would be to provide an
alternative cash source to struggling artists.

The site will also include a blog section in which writers would be able to post their thoughts
in any way(it could be a pictogram)

The art FORM wouldn't be defined therefore musicians/graphic designers/actors would have a page
that would be, in a sense, their portfolio; exhibiting their strongest work and qualifications (amongst other things)
